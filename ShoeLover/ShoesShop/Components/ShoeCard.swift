The University Blue colorway draws a close resemblance to the extremely rare Air Jordan 4 UNC PE that was given to Tarheel student-athletes in 2019.\n\nThe Air Jordan 4 University Blue features a University Blue suede upper with mesh netting on the quarter panel and tongue. Similar to OG Jordan 4 colorways of the past, the eyelets, heel tab, and sections of the midsole are a speckled Cement Grey. Hits of black appear on the wing eyelets, sole, and Jumpman logo on the heel tab. Two woven labels are stitched to the tongue; one being the classic Jumpman woven label; the other being a Team Jordan jock tag. A black, white, and Tech Grey sole with a clear Air unit completes the design.\n\nThe Air Jordan 4 University Blue released in April of 2021 and retailed for $200."))
